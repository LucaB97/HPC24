Areas for Improvement:

1) Pivot Selection:
In the partitioning function, the pivot selection could be improved. Currently, you're using the last element as the pivot, 
which can lead to poor performance if the data is already sorted or nearly sorted. Consider using the "median of three" strategy 
(median of the first, middle, and last elements) to improve partitioning.

2) Memory Management:
The merge function could potentially cause memory issues due to multiple malloc and realloc calls. 
Ensure that the system has enough memory for these operations, especially for large datasets. 
Additionally, consider checking if realloc fails, as you've done, but also handle the situation more gracefully.

3) Edge Cases:
Consider handling edge cases explicitly, such as when N is very small or when the number of processes exceeds N. 
Although these might be rare in practice, it's good to have safeguards.

4) Verbose Output:
The VERBOSE and DEBUG macros are useful for debugging, but ensure that they don't overwhelm the output during normal execution.
 You might want to include an option to control the verbosity level dynamically.
